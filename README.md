# REPO
This is a really basic mod for the video game REPO that uses [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/)
It's my first Unity mod to get into game hacking/modding and adds a bunch of keybinds for different cheats, some of which are disabled features left in the release but turned off for players

## Interface
This is a basic mod before knowing how to create a proper interface in Unity/C# so most of the effects print a message in the Melonloader pop up window for you to know what is happening when you press one of the hotkeys
Maybe sometime in the future I will learn how to make a GUI and render something for a better user experience but this is whats gonna have to work for the moment

## Keybinds
F1 - God Mode (locks player health)
F2 - Debug Energy (prevents energy from draining, giving you infinite sprint)
F3 - Infinite Jump (you can jump multiple times without touching the ground
F4 - Disable Tumble (debug option that prevents you from tumbling, doesnt always work if you are in someone else lobby)
F5 - VShift Up (teleports your player upwards enough to be on the roof of the map)
F6 - VShift Down (teleports your player to floor level regardless of if you are above on the map, or below near the death barrier)
F8 - Toggle Stregth (switches between a debug strenght of 5 and the current strenght of 1. If you use an upgrade, it adds to whichever the currently set value is)
F9 - Collision (toggles player collision allowing you to walk through walls, but also fall through the floor)
F10 - Zero Gravity (turns on the zero gravity effect, but you still fall but very slowly)
9 - Disable Map Overlay (gets rid of the map overlay question marks on undiscovered rooms
0 - Toggle Post Processing (the camera effects)
Minus - decrease movement speed (bottoms out at zero)
Equals - increase movement speed (multiplies your base speed by how many times you press it)
